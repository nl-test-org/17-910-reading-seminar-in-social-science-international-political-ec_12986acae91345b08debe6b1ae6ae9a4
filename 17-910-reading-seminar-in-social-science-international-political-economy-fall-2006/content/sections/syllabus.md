Course Overview
---------------

This course examines the politics of international economic relations. Government decision making in areas such as trade policy, exchange rates, and financial flows are influenced not only by economic factors, but also by political processes within and among countries. Only by systematically analyzing these political processes can we understand and explain the actual patterns of economic exchange that we observe - both today and throughout history. This course begins with a discussion of the analytical "lenses" through which we can view the global economy. It then examines the politics of trade policy, the internationalization of production (i.e., multinational corporations), international monetary and financial relations, third-world development and communist transition; and the debate over "globalization." Along the way, we will discuss some "hot-button" issues in the global economy: the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering; the proper role of international financial institutions (including the IMF); and the impact of the global economy on the ability of governments to make policy within their own borders.

### In-Class Examination

An in-class examination will be given in Ses #11, which will cover material from the readings, lectures, and class discussions. No make-up exams will be given.

### Take-Home Essay Exam

For this 8-page (approximate length) essay, due in class on Ses #21, you will answer an essay question distributed in class on Ses #19. Your essay should be based on the material from the readings, lectures, and class discussions, and must be double-spaced in 12-point font. The essay is due in class - no email attachments, please. Late papers will be penalized with a full letter grade deduction per 24 hours. Collaboration with other students is **not** permitted.

### Final Examination

The two-hour final examination will have two parts, each of which will count for one half of the exam grade. The first part will ask you to identify and discuss the significance of important concepts, events, and processes contained in the course. The second part will ask you to answer one of two essay questions, similar in style to the take-home essay.

### Class Participation

Class participation includes attendance and active involvement in class discussions. In addition, students are required to write four "reaction papers" (approximately two pages in length), each of which synthesizes and critiques a week's readings.

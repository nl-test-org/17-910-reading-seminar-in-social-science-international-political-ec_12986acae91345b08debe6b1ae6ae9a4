In-class Exam
-------------

The Oatley textbook contains several key terms (in bold) throughout the text, and repeated at the end of each chapter. For the in-class exam, eleven of these terms (IDs) will be presented. Select nine terms, and for each term provide a definition or description and discuss its importance for the study of international political economy. Cite examples from the readings and lectures where appropriate.

Take-home Essay Exam
--------------------

The class has presented four analytical frameworks (or “lenses”) through which to understand developments in the international political economy:

*   Domestic interests
*   Domestic institutions
*   International political (distribution of power)
*   International economics and institutions

Choose an issue-area from the [syllabus]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus)/[readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) (for example, multinational corporations) and use two analytical frameworks to discuss how and why developments in that issue-area vary over time and across countries. Are the analytical frameworks complementary or contradictory? Which do you find more compelling and why? Limit your essay to 10 pages, and cite examples from the readings and lectures where appropriate.

Final Exam
----------

The final exam will be combination of the prior two assignments: the first part of the exam will contain IDs from throughout the Oatley textbook; the second part of the exam will be an essay in which you use two analytical frameworks to discuss an important phenomenon in the international political economy.
